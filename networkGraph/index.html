                         solidarity and support to their Black audiences.
                        <br>Concurrently several high-profile white actors on popular TV shows like <strong>Big Mouth</strong> 
                        and <strong>Central Park </strong>step down from their roles playing black or biracial characters. 
                        <br>Me reading articles on my couch: " That's great but, who put them there in the first place?" 
                        
                    
                         According to their 2019 study only 3% of animated TV and film
                        roles went to women of color. In addition between 2007 and 2016 only one black director helmed an animated film. 
                        Seeing these numbers I set out to make a data vis only there was no dataset. That's when I had to get creative.
                    </p> -->
                <p> 


                    Using a Black feminist lens I aim to invesitgate the
                    role of decisionmakers in the "reliable or unreliable" storytelling
                    of popular animated TV series of the last three decades. 

                    Reliability is a term in coined by Dominique C. Hill through her research with Black girls.<br> <br>
                     Being "Black girl reliable" requires a few things:
               
                    
                    
                    <ul style ="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">
                        <li> <strong style="color: #C5DD22">Space:</strong> The spaces we make for Black girls must be or working toward being expansive, imaginative, and thoughtful 
                            enough to hold a celebration of all Black girls.</li>
                        <li> <strong style="color: #C5DD22">Intimacy</strong> Creating communal teaching and learning spaces
                            with the intention to learn with each other in community NOT observe and extract knowledge from Black girls. </li>
                        <li> <strong style="color: #C5DD22" >Empathy:</strong> See ourselves in Black girls and them in us. Black girls are knowledge producers and full of 
                            solutions to issues they and other minoritized individuals face. </li>
                        
                    </ul> <br>
                </p>
                
                <p >
                    I believe these principles can be exapanded beyond research with Black girls.
                    What can it look like when those with decision making power are "reliable to"
                    the communities of color they are looking to portray? What if the push for diversity 
                    on screen translated to more people of color in the writing room? Directing?
                    Voice acting? <br>

                    This project examines the "social network" of the American animation industry, focusing on content creators of the last 30 years. 
                    Though repsresentation on screen is improving what's even more important is who gets to tell the stories of minoritized communities.
                    <strong style="color: #C5DD22">
                        What does changing the face of animated characters but not the artistic and producing bodies do to the genre?
                        How is representation of Black characters in animation different when Black people are the creators?
                        What can it look like for studios to reliably represent communities of color?
                    </strong>
                    
                    While pondering these questions I couldn't help but think of my own childhood and the shows that resonated with me growing up,
                    like  <strong style="color: #C5DD22">The Proud Family</strong> and <strong style="color: #C5DD22">Happily Ever After Fairy Tales for Every Child</strong>.  
                    Who were the people behind some of my favorite shows? Did they look like me? How did that affect the final product?
                    As we all know in Hollywood its all about who you know, so with this project I set out to create that network of people visually.

                    Though that was noble of them I wondered "Who put them there?"  -->
                    Earlier this year, amid national unrest due to police brutality, a shake up 
                    also occurred in Hollywood. White actors stepped down from prominent roles on popular 
                    animated TV series like Big Mouth and Central Park, citing that they no longer felt comfortable
                    playing these characters. 
                    Yes, this was noble of the actors for calling for change, but again I wondered who put them there? 
                    No data was availble as I tried to find the answer BUT the Annenburg Insittue had some pretty interesting 
                    things to say on the matter. <br><br>


                    The Annenberg Institute in California is the premeire research body on diversity in Hollywood. 
                    According to their survey of 120 animated films and 100 animated TV series, women, espeically women of color, are having difficulty 
                    reaching leadership positions. Although many of the top animation programs in the country are majority women (roughly 69% in 2018) only
                    only 7%- 10% of leadership positions in animation studios (running story, writing, and unit heads) were held by women.
                    In addition, only 3% of animated TV show directors were women of color.

                I could not find any data on my topic so I decided to make one! 
                To create my dataset I combined several different files that IMDb has made available to the public.  
                IMDb gives you the up to 10 people that have worked on a show based on how  they are ordered on the IMDb page for that show or film.
                The people in this data set are not chosen by me they are the people who were in The IMDb datasets. 
                I removed all shows created outside the United States from the dataset to focus on American TV shows.
                
                I then scoured Google, Wikipedia, and the fandom pages of individual shows for additional information,
                like the original TV network a show debuted on, race of people in my dataset and their gender. <br>
                    <br>
                The graph below includes information for the 50 most popular American animated series from 1989 to the present. 
                I used the total number of votes on IMDB as the measure for popularity and chose 1989 as the start year 
                since that was the year <stong>The Simpsons</stong>, the longest running scripted TV series began.  
                I used a visualization by <a href = "https://observablehq.com/@ravengao/force-directed-graph-with-cola-grouping">Raven Gao</a> 
                as inspiration for my project. <br>

                    Often shows like Craig of the Creek are created and produced by Black people. 
                    In addition, the show has been met with rave reviews from fans and critics alike 
                     for getting normalizing Black life.  <br><br>-->
                     "Reliablity to" the Black community is evident on and off screen.
                     <strong>Craig of the Creek </strong> unlike most shows of its kind
                     was created by two white men. Both had worked on <strong>Steven Universe</strong> prior to creating the show.

                    Thinking of the Black community as a diverse group of people not a monolithic character archetype 
                    the  creative team set out to find the talent within the community who could support this story in an authentic way. <strong style="color: #C5DD22;">(Empathy)</strong> 
                    They set out to create a <strong style="color: #C5DD22;">space</strong> where writing staff could
                    imagine and explore what is could look like to have a show about black family just living their everyday lives.
                      
                     Artists and leadership were brought in for their knowledge and trusted to show the complexity of the 
                     Black experience, not the caraicature that comes with racialization <strong style="color: #C5DD22;">(Intimacy)</strong>.
                     
                     <!-- Creative team connection to the community they protray allows <br> -->
                     
                   What makes this show shine for so many, is it's depiction of black people as just that --people. 
                     Not enslaved, gang involved, struggling or angry, just a happy family living their best lives.

                    his aunt runs away from the childrens water fight becasue she doesnt want to get her hair wet. Small moments that make a world of difference
                    to the people within the community. A way to be see yourself reflected back on screen is a powerful thing. -->

                        <h2>Social Media, Webtoon, and Crunchyroll</h2>
                        <p> Thanks to the internet there are many accessible platforms for publication like Instagram and Webtoon. 
                         Both allow people are able to create their own and have access to imagery outside of mainstream television. 
                         Thanks to social media there are communitites of artists of color creating and sharing 
                         their versions popular cartoons and new works that they're creating. 
                         Webtoon, a free site where people can post their 
                         comics,  has a partnership with Crunchyroll an online cartoon streaming service. 
                         The two have teamed up to animate popular series from Webtoon on the Cruncyrolll site. 
                         I believe these newer, more consumer centered, forms of production and distribution will change the landscape in animation.

                    <p>Kiana has always had a passion for art and technology. 
                    A recent graduate of the Emerging Media program at CUNY Hunter College, 
                    she was looking for ways to use her skills to further the field.
