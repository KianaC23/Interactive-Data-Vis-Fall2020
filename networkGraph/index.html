                <p>This project examines the "social network" of the American animation industry, focusing on content creators of the last 30 years. 
                    Though repsresentation on screen 
                is improving what's even more important is who gets to tell the stories of people of color. As we all know in Hollywood its all about who you know,
                so with this project I set out to create that network of people visually. In addition I was interested in the counterculter that had been able to 
                form thanks to social media and other online avenues. The chart below is a network graph of a social network within TV networks.
                Try saying that 5 times fast! But before that let's add some context.

                <p>Summer of 2020 several high-profile white actors on popular TV shows like <strong>Big Mouth</strong> 
                and <strong>Central Park </strong>stepped down from their roles playing black or biracial characters. Though that was noble of them I couldn't help but wonder
                "Who put them there?" "Who are the writers and producers of these shows that we love?" </p>

                <p>There is only one annual study by the 
                Annenberg Institute in California on diversity in Hollywood. According to their 2019 study only 3% of roles in animated TV and film
                went to women of color. In addition between 2007 and 2016 only one black director helmed an animated film. Seeing these numbers and
                the gap in the field I set out to create a dataset that I would be working with.

          
                In order to do this I combined several different files that IMDb has made available to the public.  
                IMDb gives you the up to 10 people that have worked on a show or a phone based on how 
                they are ordered on the IMDb page for that show or film, so the people in this data set are not chosen 
                by me they are the people who were in The IMDb datasets.
                In addition I added information through my own searches on Google, Wikipedia, and the fandom pages of individual shows. 
                Shout-outs to the fandom pages! Y'all had everything I couldn't find easily. 
                The graph below includes information for the 50 most popular American animated series from 1989 to the present. 
                I based my design off of an observable by Raven Gao.</p> <br>
