                    <p>Summer 2020: Amid national unrest, many companies are prioritizing diverse and inclusive content to show
                         solidarity and support to their Black audiences.
                        Concurrently several high-profile white actors on popular TV shows like <strong>Big Mouth</strong> 
                        and <strong>Central Park </strong>step down from their roles playing black or biracial characters. 
                        Me reading articles on my couch: " That's great but, who put them there in the first place?" 
                        
                    
                        <!-- According to their 2019 study only 3% of animated TV and film
                        roles went to women of color. In addition between 2007 and 2016 only one black director helmed an animated film. 
                        Seeing these numbers I set out to make a data vis only there was no dataset. That's when I had to get creative. -->

                     Using a black feminist lens I aim to invesitgate 
                    role of gatekeepers/decisionmakers in the "reliable or unreliable" storytelling
                    of popular animated TV series from 1989 to the present. 

                    Reliability is a term in coined by Dominique Hill through her research with Black girls.<br> <br>
                     Being "Black girl reliable" requires a few things:
               
                    
                    
                    <ul style ="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">
                        <li>The spaces we make for Black girls must be or working toward being expansive, imaginative, and thoughtful 
                            enough to hold a celebration of all Black girls.</li>
                        <li> Intimacy creating communal teaching and learning spaces
                            with the intention to learn with each other in community NOT conduct reareach on a group 
                        and report findings </li>
                        <li> See ourselves in Black girls and them in us. Black girls are knowledge producers and full of 
                            solutions to issues they and other minoritized individuals face. </li>
                        
                    </ul> <br>
                </p>
                
                <p style="color: #C5DD22">
                    I believe these principles can be exapanded beyond research with Black girls.
                    What can it look like when those with decision making power are "reliable to"
                    the communities of color they are looking to portray? What if the push for diversity 
                    on screen translated to more people of color in the writing room? Directing?
                    Voice acting? <br>

                    This project examines the "social network" of the American animation industry, focusing on content creators of the last 30 years. 
                    Though repsresentation on screen is improving what's even more important is who gets to tell the stories of people of color.
                    What does changing the face of animated characters but not the artistic and producing bodies do to the genre?
                    How is representation of Black characters in animation different when Black people are the creators?
                    What can it look like for studios to reliably represent communities of color?
                    While pondering these questions I couldn't help but think of my own childhood and the shows that resonated with me growing up,
                    like  <strong>The Proud Family</strong>, <strong>Happily Ever After Fairy Tales for Every Child</strong>,  
                    and others.  Who were the people behind some of my favorite shows? Did they look like me? How did that affect the final product?
                    As we all know in Hollywood its all about who you know, so this project I set out to create that network of people visually.

                To create my dataset I combined several different files that IMDb has made available to the public.  
                IMDb gives you the up to 10 people that have worked on a show based on how  they are ordered on the IMDb page for that show or film.
                The people in this data set are not chosen by me they are the people who were in The IMDb datasets. 
                I removed all shows created outside the United States from the dataset to focus on American TV shows.
                
                I then scoured Google, Wikipedia, and the fandom pages of individual shows for additional information,
                like the original TV network a show debuted on, race of people in my dataset and their gender. <br>
                    <br>
                The graph below includes information for the 50 most popular American animated series from 1989 to the present. 
                I used the total number of votes on IMDB as the measure for popularity and chose 1989 as the start year 
                since that was the year <stong>The Simpsons</stong>, the longest running animated series began.  
                I used an observable by Raven Gao as inspiration for this project. <br>

                <p>  An example of reliability in practice is the creative team of the <strong>Craig of the Creek</strong> .
                    The Cartoon Network show surrounds the playful Craig and his family. Though it follows the trend of having a Black creative team on a black show
                    one big difference is the creators of this show are two white men. 
                    Often projects like Craig of the Creek are created and produced by Black people. 
                    Craig is a young boy that just happens to be Black.
                    As a result Craig of the Creek has been met with rave reviews from fans and critics alike 
                     for getting diversity and inclusion right and normalizing Black life.

                     <br><br> staff given the space to imagine/explore what is could look like to 
                     have a show about black family just living their everyday lives. Artists brought in seen as
                     already being experts and knowers, connection to the community they protray allows for Intimacy
                     and collective <br>
                     
                    I think a place where the show shines is showing black people as just that --people. 
                    Same as everyone else. Not enslaved, disenfranchised, or angry just a family living their lives.
                    
                    

                    <!-- The writing has nuance specific to the Black American experience
                    that is specific to lived exprience. Craig's mother went to an HBCU, his grandmother tells him to shower becasue he "smalls like outside", 
                    his aunt runs away from the childrens water fight becasue she doesnt want to get her hair wet. Small moments that make a world of difference
                    to the people within the community. A way to be see yourself reflected back on screen is a powerful thing. -->
                    
                    
                    Noticing the gap
                    in black woman animators Taylor Shaw created Black Women Animate in 2018. This organization
                    serves as a space for Black women animators to network, offers professional development
                    opportuinites and recently held their first annual Awards in partnership with Cartoon Network.
